PyMOL must be installed in order to properly run this script. 

It can be downloaded at the following address: https://www.pymol.org/

Upon starting the script, the user will be prompted to enter .pdb files for the proteins of interest.

These can be downloaded from the protein databank: http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do

To view alignment objects (named align_moleculeName) in sequence viewer, make sure only one is selected (all are selected by default). If multiple are selected, only the highest one in the list are shown.

Nonbinding residues exist, but are hidden by default. To enable them, use the [S] in the sidebar next to the 'nonbind' selections.
